                Hello! we are Black crow we are a team that enjoys creating things
                that live on the internet . we are interested in web developement
                started back in 2020. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the
                privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
                corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days
                is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
                Upstatement for a variety of clients. I also recently launched a
                course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the
                Spotify API using Node and React.
