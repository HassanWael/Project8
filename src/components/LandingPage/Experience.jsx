        Hello! we are Black crow we are a team that enjoys creating things that
        live on the internet . we are interested in web developement started
        back in 2020. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of
        working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
        student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
        accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement
        for a variety of clients. I also recently launched a course that covers
        everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node
        and React.
